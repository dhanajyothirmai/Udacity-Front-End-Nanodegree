                                Google Partner Innovation is a 2-day programme focusing on the latest Google AI technologies such as TensorFlow JS and ML kit. The event was held on 29th and 30th January, a 36-hour hackathon. There were many elite companies whose problem statements were solved by developers using the Tensorflow and ML kit of Google with mentorship from Google. We built prototypes for the respective clients during this event. Clients walked away with ideas to scale them and, to portray it to the market.

                                The core team from Sathyabama Coding Club, Abhiram Reddy Duggempudi, Anish J, Akash M, Dewashish, Dhanasri Jyothirmai, and Teja Kummarikuntla were very happy to get invited for Google's Partner Innovation programme at Google office in Bangalore.

                                The core team also got a chance to interact with Googlers from other countries and got various insights, to how creative engineers, co-exist to solve real world business problems. Similarly, the core team also worked to solve and got a good response from both, the client teams(Swiggy and CRED) and the partner team(Google PI).
